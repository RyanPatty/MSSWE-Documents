This app uses the Abstract Factory design pattern: 'StudentFactory.js' to model different types of 'student' entities: graduates and undergraduates,
which can be either national or international.

I designed two concrete factories NationalStudentFactory and InternationalStudentFactory which implement the blueprint provided StudentFactory

The students are stored in an array data structure after being created.

The user can find certain types of students by searching or 'querying' our list based on what they need."

The user can also add new students to the system, which is referred to as 'insertion'.

The user can also delete students from the system, which is referred to as 'deletion'.

//(Not implemented)The user can also update students in the system, which is referred to as 'update'.

The user can also view all students in the system, which is referred to as 'view'.
